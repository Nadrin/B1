# BENDER-I Computer Emulator

(c) Copyright 2015 Michał Siejak

**BENDER-I** (or B1 for short) is a fictional computer system I've created for fun and profit (well, maybe only for fun). The name is, of course, a tribute to [Bender Bending Rodríguez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama)), a fictional character in the animated series Futurama, who happens to be powered by the same CPU as B1 computer. 

Currently there are no hardware implementations of the B1 computer. The reference, and only, implementation is the B1 Emulator.

For source code, emulator binaries and documentation related to B1 visit: https://www.siejak.pl/projects/b1

The B1 manual is available here: https://www.siejak.pl/files/b1/b1-manual.pdf
